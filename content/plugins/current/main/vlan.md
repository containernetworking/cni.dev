## Overview
The vlan plugin creates a vlan subinterface off an enslaved interface in the host network namespace and the container using a veth device. One end of the veth pair is placed inside a container and the other end is a subinterface off the master in the host network namespace. The host-local IPAM plugin can be used to allocate an IP address to the container. The traffic of the container interface will be routed through the interface of the host.

## Example network configuration

```json
{
	"name": "mynet",
	"type": "vlan",
	"master": "eth0",
	"mtu": 1500,
	"vlanId": 5,
	"ipam": {
		"type": "host-local",
		"subnet": "10.1.1.0/24"
	},
	"dns": {
		"nameservers": [ "10.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8" ]
	}
}
```
