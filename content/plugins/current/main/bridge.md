## Overview

With bridge plugin, all containers (on the same host) are plugged into a bridge (virtual switch) that resides in the host network namespace.
The containers receive one end of the veth pair with the other end connected to the bridge.
An IP address is only assigned to one end of the veth pair -- one residing in the container.
The bridge itself can also be assigned an IP address, turning it into a gateway for the containers.
Alternatively, the bridge can function purely in L2 mode and would need to be bridged to the host network interface (if other than container-to-container communication on the same host is desired).

The network configuration specifies the name of the bridge to be used.
If the bridge is missing, the plugin will create one on first use and, if gateway mode is used, assign it an IP that was returned by IPAM plugin via the gateway field.

## Example configuration
```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "type": "bridge",
    "bridge": "mynet0",
    "isDefaultGateway": true,
    "forceAddress": false,
    "ipMasq": true,
    "hairpinMode": true,
    "ipam": {
        "type": "host-local",
        "subnet": "10.10.0.0/16"
    }
}
```

## Example L2-only configuration
```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "type": "bridge",
    "bridge": "mynet0",
    "ipam": {}
}
```

## Example L2-only, disabled interface configuration
```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "type": "bridge",
    "bridge": "mynet0",
    "disableContainerInterface": true
}
```

## Example L2-only, port isolation enabled
```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "type": "bridge",
    "bridge": "mynet0",
    "portIsolation": "true"
}
```

## Network configuration reference

* `name` (string, required): the name of the network.
* `type` (string, required): "bridge".
* `bridge` (string, optional): name of the bridge to use/create. Defaults to "cni0".
* `isGateway` (boolean, optional): assign an IP address to the bridge. Defaults to false.
* `isDefaultGateway` (boolean, optional): Sets isGateway to true and makes the assigned IP the default route. Defaults to false.
* `forceAddress` (boolean, optional): Indicates if a new IP address should be set if the previous value has been changed. Defaults to false.
* `ipMasq` (boolean, optional): set up IP Masquerade on the host for traffic originating from this network and destined outside of it. Defaults to false.
* `ipMasqBackend` (string, optional): IP masquerading implementation to use when `ipMasq` is true. Can be "iptables" or "nftables". Defaults to "iptables", unless only "nftables" is available.
* `mtu` (integer, optional): explicitly set MTU to the specified value. Defaults to the value chosen by the kernel.
* `hairpinMode` (boolean, optional): set hairpin mode for interfaces on the bridge. Defaults to false.
* `ipam` (dictionary, required): IPAM configuration to be used for this network. For L2-only network, create empty dictionary.
* `promiscMode` (boolean, optional): set promiscuous mode on the bridge. Defaults to false.
* `vlan` (int, optional): assign VLAN tag. Defaults to none.
* `preserveDefaultVlan` (boolean, optional): indicates whether the default vlan must be preserved on the veth end connected to the bridge. Defaults to true.
* `vlanTrunk` (list, optional): assign VLAN trunk tag. Defaults to none.
* `enabledad` (boolean, optional): enables duplicate address detection for the container side veth. Defaults to false.
* `macspoofchk` (boolean, optional): Enables mac spoof check, limiting the traffic originating from the container to the mac address of the interface. Defaults to false.
* `disableContainerInterface` (boolean, optional): Set the container interface (veth peer inside the container netns) state down. When enabled, IPAM cannot be used.
* `portIsolation` (boolean, optional): Set isolation on the host interface (veth peer in root netns). When enabled containers can communicate only with the host, or through the gateway. Defaults to false.

## VLAN capabilities

The `vlan` and `vlanTrunk` parameters can be used individually or together to configure VLAN tagging on the host end of the veth pair and enable `vlan_filtering` on the bridge interface.

**Access Port (Single VLAN):**

Use the `vlan` parameter by itself to tag all traffic on the interface with a specific VLAN ID. This is equivalent to an access port on a physical switch.

**Trunk Port (Multiple VLANs):**

To create a trunk port, use both `vlan` and `vlanTrunk`.

*   `vlan`: Sets the native VLAN for the trunk.  If omitted, the native VLAN defaults to 1.
*   `vlanTrunk`: Specifies the allowed VLANs on the trunk, either as a single ID or a range.

*Note:* To configure uplink for L2 network you need to allow the vlan on the uplink interface by using the following command ``` bridge vlan add vid VLAN_ID dev DEV```.

### Example L2 vlan configuration
```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "type": "bridge",
    "bridge": "mynet0",
    "vlan": 100,
    "ipam": {}
}
```

### Example L2 vlan trunk configuration
```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "type": "bridge",
    "bridge": "mynet0",
    "vlan": 100,
    "vlanTrunk": [
      { "id": 101 },
      { "minID": 200, "maxID": 299 }],
    "ipam": {}
}
```

## Interface configuration arguments reference

The following [CNI_ARGS](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#parameters) are supported:

* `MAC`: request a specific MAC address for the interface

    (example: CNI_ARGS="MAC=c2:11:22:33:44:55")

Note: You may add `IgnoreUnknown=true` to allow loose CNI argument verification (see CNI's issue[#560](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/issues/560)).

The plugin also support following [capability argument](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md).

* `mac`: Pass MAC addresses for CNI interface

The following [args conventions](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md#args-in-network-config) are supported:

* `mac` (string, optional): MAC address (i.e. hardware address) of interface
