## Why develop CNI?

Application containers on Linux are a rapidly evolving area, and within this area networking is not well addressed as it is highly environment-specific.
We believe that many container runtimes and orchestrators will seek to solve the same problem of making the network layer pluggable.

To avoid duplication, we think it is prudent to define a common interface between the network plugins and container execution: hence we put forward this specification, along with libraries for Go and a set of plugins.

## Who is using CNI?

### Container runtimes
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) - a system to simplify container operations
- [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) - a simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across on-prem and clouds at scale
- [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) - a CRI-compliant container runtime
- [cri-o](https://cri-o.io/) - a lightweight container runtime
- [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/openshift_networking_requirements.md) - Kubernetes with additional enterprise features
- [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release) - a platform for cloud applications
- [Apache Mesos](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/docs/cni.md) - a distributed systems kernel
- [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) - a highly scalable, high performance container management service
- [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) - a container platform optimized for HPC, EPC, and AI
- [OpenSVC](https://docs.opensvc.com/latest/fr/agent.configure.cni.html) - an orchestrator for legacy and containerized application stacks

The CNI team also maintains some [core plugins in a separate repository](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins).

## Contributing to CNI

We welcome contributions, including [bug reports](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/issues), code, and documentation improvements.
If you intend to contribute to code or documentation, please read the [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/contributing/) page and see the [contact section](#contact) of this page.

## How do I use CNI?

### Requirements

The CNI spec is language agnostic. To use the Go language libraries in this repository, you'll need a recent version of Go.

### Reference Plugins

The CNI project maintains a set of [reference plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) that implement the CNI specification.

## What might CNI do in the future?

CNI currently covers a wide range of needs for network configuration due to its simple model and API.
However, in the future CNI might want to branch out into other directions:

- Dynamic updates to existing network configuration
- Dynamic policies for network bandwidth and firewall rules

If these topics are of interest, please contact the team via the mailing list or IRC and find some like-minded people in the community to put a proposal together.

## Where are the binaries?

The plugins have been moved to a separate repo:
[https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins), and the releases there include binaries and checksums.

Prior to release 0.7.0 the `cni` release also included a `cnitool` binary; as this is a developer tool we suggest you build it yourself.
